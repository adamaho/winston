# Winston

Winston is a dotfiles + setup repo for SSH-based development.

## Quickstart

1. Configure Ubuntu VPS system settings with `scripts/configure-vps.sh`.
2. Install development tooling on your host or VPS with `scripts/configure-dev.sh`.
3. Dotfiles are stowed automatically by `scripts/configure-dev.sh` (use `--skip-stow` to skip).

## Documentation

- VPS system setup: `docs/vps-ubuntu.md`
- Dev environment setup: `docs/dev-environment.md`
